# Computer Simulation Project
## During my third term, I was working in a group of two people, to create a program, which would simulate motorway gates. Of course, there are a plenty of simplifications, its hard to count them at all, but main idea was to compare system in which cars are waiting in one common queue to system, where cars are divided into a few queues.
